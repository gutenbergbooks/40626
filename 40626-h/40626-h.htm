<p><span class="smcap">Dear Toby, Ahoy!</span></p>

<p>Where are <i>you</i> bound? Haul on the bowline; brace up
amidships; sling your hammock; belay all hands and
stand by ready to pounce.</p>

<p>Excuse this little outburst. The fact is, I am about to cut
for awhile landlubber associations, and am going cruising
in my <i>Pandora's</i> box, or rather berth. My sea lingo is
getting a little rusty, so I practise it wherever I have an
opportunity, and thought you wouldn't mind my making
one with you. I am going off to spend Christmas and New
Year's time at Pau. You've heard of Pau, of course? I
was first attracted to the place by coming across the beautiful line from
<span class="smcap">Goldsmith</span>&mdash;or was it <span class="smcap">Bacon</span>?</p>

<p class="center">"Or by the lazy Scheldt or wandering Pau."</p>

<p>I'm not at all drawn towards the Scheldt. I never was lazy myself, and have
no sympathy with laziness in others. But it is different with Pau, don't you
know. I have been tied to the desk too long. I had a heavy time of it during
the Parliamentary Session. They used to chaff me about being "on the pounce."
It is all very well, but the attitude is one which, preserved through successive
nights, becomes exhausting. I have had enough of it, and feel a strong desire
to wander. The Pau is wandering. Why should we not wander together, arm
in arm as it were? Anyhow, I mean to try. So bear a hand with your lee-scuppers;
haul round the mainmast, up with your hatches, and keep the helm
hard down on the South-West-by-East-Half-East. I have pounced enough
on the Parnellites. Now I shall pounce on Pau.</p>

<p>I feel the necessity for taking a good rest, for I know we are going to have it
pretty stiff next Session. <span class="smcap">B-lf-r</span>, who is getting more cocky than ever, goes
about comforting us with assurances that he will make matters smooth. "Is
there anyone particular you can't abear?" he said to me only yesterday, with
an annoying air of patronage. "Is there anyone of the Irish Members you
would like put out of the way for the earliest and freshest months of the
Session? If so, name your man, and I'll oblige you. I have got six of 'em
lagged now, and there's a clear six weeks before Parliament meets. It's
amazing how we can smooth the way by then."</p>

<p>I don't altogether like this solicitude on the part of <span class="smcap">B-lf-r</span> for making
smooth water in the House next Session. There is a persistent rumour about
that he thinks he can lead the House better than anyone else, and that the
Markiss is inclined to humour him. He has never said this in private conversation
with me, though he has not made any attempt to disguise his conviction
that he could take charge of the Army, the Navy, the Home Office, the Board
of Trade, or even the Exchequer. Now I come to think of it, he may, in talking
to <span class="smcap">G-sch-n</span>, leave out reference to the Exchequer, and substitute the Leadership
of the House of Commons, and so with the others. I should certainly like to see
him in my place for a week, with <span class="smcap">Gr-nd-lph</span> on the corner of the bench behind.
It is true that of late <span class="smcap">Gr-nd-lph</span> has considerably flattened down. Having found
that impudence and caprice don't pay, he is going in for dulness and respectability.
But I fancy the sight of <span class="smcap">Arth-r B-lf-r</span> leading the House, and trying to lead
him, would be too much. The swept and garnished place
would be reoccupied, and his last state would be worse
than his first. <span class="smcap">B-lf-r</span> can't very well send him to a
plank bed, and will have to make the best of him.</p>

<p>I rather fancy <span class="smcap">Gr-nd-lph</span> must know, or think he
knows, something about this little plot for promoting
the nephew, which accounts for his latest impertinence.
"And what title do you mean to take when you go to
the House of Lords, H. W.?" he asked me the other
day. (He always calls me "H. W." which he thinks is
an improvement upon <span class="smcap">Dizzy's</span> hesitation as to the
sequence of the initials.) "How would Baron <span class="smcap">Bookstall</span>
suit?" he added, trying to look harmless. That only
shows the inherent vulgarity which underlies the thin
veneer of his sometime courtly manner. I never forget
what the Markiss once said about him. "Scratch
<span class="smcap">R-nd-lph Ch-rch-ll</span>," said he, "and you'll find <span class="smcap">Tim
H-ly</span>," which I thought at the time was a little hard
on <span class="smcap">T-m</span>.</p>

<p>You will not, I trust, dear <span class="smcap">Toby</span>, take it for granted
that I am contemplating a near removal to the House of
Lords, if I confess that I <i>have</i> sometimes thought over
the title I should assume if my duty to my country led
me to change my state. I belong, as you know, to one
of the oldest families among mankind. It's all very
well for <span class="smcap">Br-ss-y</span> to talk about coming over with the
Conqueror. We came in with the Flood, or shortly after.
<span class="smcap">Tubal Cain</span>, the founder of our family, was a century
or two before <span class="smcap">Bois De Guilbert, Front-De-B&oelig;f</span>, or
even the <span class="smcap">Sieur de Bresci</span>. What do you think of
Lord <span class="smcap">Tubal-Cain</span>? Would you recognise in that stately
and ermined peer, <span class="smcap">Tubal-Cain</span>, of Henley, your old
friend of 217, Strand? I wis not. But that, as
<span class="smcap">Gl-dst-ne</span> says, belongs to the dim and distant future.
I beg to move that the question be now put. Oars!
Steady, there! Pull away!</p>

<h2>ROSES IN DECEMBER.</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir</span>,&mdash;Strange as it may appear to you, Sir, as a
London playgoer, I had never seen <i>The Two Roses</i> till
last night. How this "celebrated comedy" ever acquired
its celebrity is, I confess, beyond me, for the plot is poor,
and in the dialogue there is nothing quotable, though
the phrase, "a little cheque," forces itself on one's
memory by frequent iteration. You, Sir, saw it with its
original cast, and I take it that a play of this sort requires
certain surroundings to insure its immediate success, just
as a rich joke, when deprived of its original accidental
accessories, is found to be a very poor joke, or no joke at
all. This play by Mr. <span class="smcap">Albery</span> I should have thought
would have been, as Dr. <span class="smcap">Samuel Johnson</span> might have
said, Al-bery'd and forgotten long ago. Yet it lives,&mdash;at
all events, it has been revived.</p>

<p>A Manager does not revive a piece which was not
originally produced at his theatre without some pretty
good reason for so doing. He must, at least, be fairly
confident of its attractive powers as, at all events, a remunerative
stop-gap; and I am informed that this piece has
been revived, once before, by Mr. <span class="smcap">Henry Irving</span> at the
Lyceum. This is ancient history to you, Sir. After the
revival, and the unwonted exercise of a long run (did it
have a long run?), I should have supposed that there
could not have been much life left in it. Yet apparently
there is. The acting is, on the whole, good, and some of
it very good. <span class="smcap">William Farren</span>, one of the best of
English players, makes all that is to be made (as it seems
to me, who did not see Mr. <span class="smcap">Irving</span>) out of <i>Digby Grand</i>,
Mr. <span class="smcap">Giddens</span> is an excellent blind <i>Caleb</i> (a very clever
actor must be Mr. <span class="smcap">Giddens</span>), and Mr. <span class="smcap">David James</span> simply
is "Our Mr. <span class="smcap">Jenkins</span>." <span class="smcap">Maude Millett</span> is pretty and
graceful, and the whole entertainment entertaining. But
still, how it ever became a celebrated comedy&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
<p>"Well, that I cannot tell," said he,</p>
<p>"But <i>t'was</i> a famous Comedy."</p>
</div>

<p>And by crammed houses it is, I hear, being fully appreciated.
Indeed, I should only say, judging by this
Criterion on the night I was present, it is in for another
long run.</p>

<h2>A VISIT TO "THE LICENSED VISTLERS."</h2>

<p>In the Winter Exhibition of the Royal Society of British Artists,
who, under their distinguished President, <span class="smcap">James McNeile Whistler</span>,
may now be known as the "Licensed Vistlers," there is some good
work, and especially two sketches, 77, 83, and 335, by <span class="smcap">James
Hayllar</span>, R.B.A.; 319, by <span class="smcap">H. G. Glindon</span>, R.B.A.; <span class="smcap">Simmons's</span>
"<i>Sunrise</i>," 330; <span class="smcap">Solomon's</span>; 454, Professor <span class="smcap">Gartz</span> (pretty subject);
458, by <span class="smcap">Henley</span>, R.B.A.; 466, by <span class="smcap">Walters</span>, R.B.A.</p>

<p>There is a remarkable picture of, apparently, A Serious Masher,
which turns out to be a portrait of Mr. <span class="smcap">Willard</span>, the actor who so
cleverly impersonates modern stage villains as to be known as
"Willinous <span class="smcap">Willard</span>," by <span class="smcap">Sidney Starr</span>, R.B.A. Artistic <span class="smcap">Starr</span>
painting Theatrical Star; quite right. No. 293 is a sorry sight&mdash;the
picture of a nice portly young man trying to look like Lord <span class="smcap">Rosebery</span>,
but with the dye coming off his hair in evident patches. Very
clever effect this, by <span class="smcap">Theodore Roussel</span>, R.B.A.</p>

<p>Go and see No. 341, by <span class="smcap">William Stott</span>, of Oldham, R.B.A.,&mdash;a name
that sounds quite Shakspearian, like "Goodman Puff of Barson,"&mdash;and
give yourself three guesses at what W. S. of Oldham means by
it. It represents a very carotty-haired young woman, looking pale
as a turnip&mdash;"white flesh," as the gardeners say&mdash;taking a bathe in
the sea when no one is looking, and where police regulations are not
in force. She is so tallowy in face and flesh colour, and her hair so
flaming red, that the title might be, "<i>A 'Dip' in the Sea</i>." Well,
this is <span class="smcap">William Stott</span> of Oldham's "<i>Venus</i>;" and if you'll turn to
No. 183, you will see the same young person, looking none the better
for her bath, clothed, with carrots dressed, and neatly bound up, sitting
pensively <i>chez-elle</i>, probably regretting her recent escapade, and
hoping that no one has seen her. Little does she know that <span class="smcap">William
Stott</span> of Oldham has stotted her down in his note-book. 326,
"<i>Hard Hit</i>," by <span class="smcap">R. J. Gordon</span>, R.B.A., is clever; but the meaning
of its title, as illustrated by a weeping woman flinging herself across
the knees of a drunken-looking man, is not quite clear. Has he hit
her hard, and is that why she is so distressed? or has his head
received a nasty thwack, as indicated by the white hat, lying on the
table, twisted out of all shape?</p>

<p>At the end of the Catalogue is printed a list of the prices, from
which it will be seen what value the artists themselves set on their
own pictures. The President of the Licensed Vistlers exhibits only
twenty pictures, sixteen of which have no price affixed to them in
the list, and are therefore evidently gems, and priceless.</p>

<hr />

<h2>Founded on Fact.</h2>

<p>A large lot of ornithologists assembled the other day at Mr. J. C.
<span class="smcap">Stevens's</span> Auction Rooms to attend the sale of an egg of the Great
Auk&mdash;a seafowl, <span class="smcap">'Arry</span>, not a falcon. Great Auks' eggs are precious.
This one was knocked down to an enthusiastic gentleman for 160 guineas.
Some years ago two eggs of a Great Auk, sold, of course, by
auktion, fetched, respectively, 100 and 200 guineas, although both
broken, and that before they were knocked down. Surely the Great
Auk must have been the original bird signified in tradition under
the name of the legendary goose that laid the golden eggs.</p>

<hr />

<p>The Premier of the French Cabinet may be well described as
"<i>Nulli Secundus</i>." He is second to nobody, for the President is
Nobody&mdash;to speak of.</p>

<h2>FURNISHING FICTIONISTS.</h2>

<p>In the <i>Atalanta Magazine</i>, for this month, (which by its title, should be ahead of all competitors
until the <i>homme &agrave; la pomme</i> appears) Mr. <span class="smcap">Walter Besant</span> has an article "On the
writing of Novels," in which he offers his advice to young girls afflicted with irrepressible scribblemania,&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>
"girls who try to write stories, and burn to write novels,"&mdash;as to the best and
easiest means of attaining their object. <i>Advice gratis</i> is, as we all know, of the gratis't value,
and Mr. <span class="smcap">Besant</span> offers his two penn'orth-of-"all-sorts and conditions," to embryonic authoresses,
but had <i>Mr. Punch</i> been dealing with these dear little literary aspirants, he would
have simply repeated his world-famed epigrammatic advice to "persons about to marry," and
said, most unequivocally, to girls about to write novels&mdash;"Don't." Not so Mr. <span class="smcap">Besant</span>, who
proceeds to lay down rules for those "who wish to acquire the art of fiction." He commences
with, "<i>Practise writing, something original everyday</i>,"&mdash;"<i>Cultivate the habit of observation</i>,"
and so on, in good old-fashioned copy-book style.</p>

<p>We will assist him with some rules for those to whom Mr. <span class="smcap">W. Besant</span> gives this advice:
"Be bold: never mind ridicule," ... "State fairly, what ordinary people never understand,
that Fiction, like Painting, is an Art, and that you are setting yourself to the acquisition of
that Art, if it be in your power, whatever may come of it in the end."</p>

<p>Very good. Now here is, as the Cookery books have it, "Another and a shorter way."</p>

<p><i>To acquire the Art of Fiction.</i>&mdash;Clearly understand that Fiction is the opposite of Fact.
If you invariably state facts, you become a matter-of-fact sort of person. No Genius is a
matter-of-fact sort of person. So to "acquire the Art of Fiction," <i>you must never tell the
truth. Practice telling some original lie every day.</i> If it be a description of scenery&mdash;well,
this offers a large field&mdash;several large fields. Give an account to your relatives, or to
your friends at a distance of the walk you have taken in the morning. First of all, of course,
to be quite perfect, <i>you must not have been out of the house</i>. You will then proceed to
describe the roaring Waterfalls over which you leaped, your hairbreadth escapes, &amp;c., &amp;c.,
and always remember that, as Mr. <span class="smcap">Besant</span> says, "description is not slavish enumeration."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rule I.</span>&mdash;<i>Tell a lie.</i> <span class="smcap">Rule II.</span>&mdash;<i>Don't stick to it, but tell another, and a bigger one.</i> Pile
'em up, and thus at last you may become an unrivalled Fictionist.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rule III.</span>&mdash;"<i>Work regularly, at certain hours.</i>" Ascertain the time the Lark rises, and
be up with it. Always be up to time, and to any amount of Larks. Let everybody in the
house know you're at work. Sing as the Lark does, and be joyous. Insist on your room
being fitted up for work,&mdash;at your parents' expense, of course,&mdash;with writing-desk, silver
inkstand, paper, pens, a library of books, &amp;c., and you must let it be distinctly understood
by everyone that you are "not to be disturbed on any account," as you are going in for
being a Fictionist.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">
Rule IV.</span>&mdash;"Read no Rubbish," says Mr. <span class="smcap">Besant</span>. But this is what every author would
say, making certain exceptions. But we should say, "<i>Read Everything</i>." <i>Then begin to
write.</i> Here is an example: say you read <i>Pickwick</i>. Well, you <i>write</i> a book called <i>Nikpik</i>,
a Russian story, plot in St. Petersburg, characters, <i>Nikpik</i>, <i>Kinkel</i>, <i>Grazsnod</i>, and <i>Putmann</i>.
You represent a sporting scene where <i>Putmann</i>, with his eyes shut, kills a bird, and afterwards
<i>Kinkel</i> wounds <i>Putmann</i>. "Hullo," says the reader, "uncommonly like <i>Pickwick</i>,
and writes impetuously and indignantly to papers. Whereupon, you write in reply, saying
"it may be so: <i>les grands esprits se rencontrent</i>: but that you have never heard of <i>Pickwick</i>,
much less read it." By this time everyone will allow that you are entitled to be regarded as
the greatest Fictionist of the age.</p>

<p>Other rules Mr. <span class="smcap">Besant</span> gives, for which anyone sufficiently interested in detecting the
errors of his advice <i>gratis</i>, may search the <i>Atalanta Magazine</i> with considerable profit to
himself (or herself) especially if he reads <i>A Christmas Carol</i>, by <span class="smcap">Christina G. Rossetti</span>,
and one tail of <i>Three Lions</i>, by that undefeated Fictionist, Mr. <span class="smcap">Rider Haggard</span>.</p>

<hr />

<h2>OUR BOOKING-OFFICE.</h2>

<p><i>Palindromes</i>, by <span class="smcap">G. R. Clarke</span>, is a series of cruelly ingenious verbal cranks&mdash;"cranks"
seems to be the word, since they are neither quips, quirks, puns, nor jests, consisting of
sentences so arranged that, read backwards or forwards, they are precisely the same. An
example of this is, "<i>Was it a rat I saw?</i>" The illustrations are comically amateurish, and
amateurishly comic, but one of the best, "<i>Selim smiles</i>," is rather in the early Thackerayan
style of pictorial art. The palindromical amusement will probably develop itself, as the acrostic
family has done, and we shall soon be reading in "Answers to Correspondents" that their
puzzle is referred to in "The Palindromical Editor." The little book is published, as any
experienced joker in Scotland might have guessed, by Messrs. <span class="smcap">Bryce and Sons</span>, Glasgow,
and if you buy it, "Bang goes a shilling."</p>

<p>Approbation from <i>Mr. Punch</i> is praise indeed, and where he has given his favourable
opinion of any book, it immediately attracts the public attention, and goes to any number of
editions. So has it chanced with <i>Frith's Recollections</i>, which has now reached its third
edition; and once <i>Mr. Punch</i> spoke well of the Jubilee Edition of <i>Pickwick</i>, which has now
been re-issued with some of the original sketches by "<span class="smcap">Buss</span>,"&mdash;to many it will be a surprise
that <i>Mr. Pickwick</i> ever took a buss, except under the mistletoe at Dingley Dell,&mdash;which
are fairly clever, though one of them, the cricketing scene, might have been omitted without
damaging the artistic character of the republication. There is a sketch by <span class="smcap">John Leech</span>,
illustrating the moment in the <i>Bagman's Story</i> when the old arm-chair wakes up <i>Tom
Smart</i>, and assumes the form and features of a gouty, but wickedly sly, old gentleman,
which alone is "worth all the money." It is a real Christmas picture; and indeed a small
volume of <i>Tales from Pickwick</i>, illustrated by fanciful and humorous artists, would make a
capital Christmas Book of the good old Dickensian sort. <i>Mr. Punch</i> has given the hint: <i>fiat!</i></p>

<p>By the way, I see an advertisement of a book quoting opinions of the Press as to its being
"the funniest book of the present reign." Heavens! It is only necessary to mention <i>Pickwick</i>,
which is replete with such real fun, as makes the reader roar with laughter irrepressible,
besides being full of genuine humour.</p>

<p>A few evenings since, I assisted at a Members' Concert in Piccadilly,
where a very fair exhibition of Amateur Musical talent was displayed
by the "Strolling Players."
The vocal part of the entertainment
was especially good, thanks
to the really charming singing of
the Misses <span class="smcap">Agnes Janson</span> and
<span class="smcap">Hamlin</span>. The geniuses in the
Orchestra who are for all time,
and any tune, managed occasionally
to get a little out of
hand in spite of Mr. <span class="smcap">Norfolk
Megone's</span> earnest conductorship.
Taken all round, "The First
Members' Concert" was so good
that I should not have the
smallest objection to attending
the Second.</p>

<p><i>The Ancient Mariner</i> with Mr.
<span class="smcap">J. F. Barnett's</span> brilliant music
at St. James's Hall last Thursday
night, held entranced a large
audience which listened "like a
three ears child" ("Had I three
ears I'd hear thee," says <i>Macbeth</i>. Did <span class="smcap">Coleridge</span> write <span class="smcap">Shakspeare</span>?&mdash;however,
this has nothing much to do with the <i>cantata</i>, and
so on we goes again)&mdash;so "the Mariner hath his Will" (which is
almost conclusive evidence that <span class="smcap">Coleridge's</span> <i>Mariner</i> was written
by <span class="smcap">Will Shakspeare</span>) and we were all delighted. I hadn't a book.
Who was <span class="smcap">Albert Ross</span> that the <i>Mariner</i> shot? Madame <span class="smcap">Patey</span> sang
"<i>O Sleep, it is a Genteel Thing!</i>" (I think these were the words)
with great feeling and expression. Beautiful idea, "sleep a genteel
thing!" Somebody told me I was wrong, and that the poet wrote,
"<i>O Sleep, it is a Gentle Thing!</i>" which anybody could have said,
without being a poet. So I prefer my own version. The recitative
(<span class="smcap">Santley</span>) and chorus (Everybody), about "the coming wind did
roar," and something (I didn't catch what) was "like a sledge," and
"the Moon was on its side and then upon its edge," which sounds
just what a harvest moon would do after a good day's harvesting,
were excellent.</p>

<p>Then followed Mr. <span class="smcap">C. V. Stanford's</span> Symphony in F Minor,
"<i>The Irish</i>" as my neighbour informed me, to which I replied,
"Oh, indeed!" and appeared, as I hope, much interested; though
what he meant I haven't the smallest idea. Who was my neighbour?&mdash;a
very learned person who kept on drawing my attention to the
excellent instrumentation, and the admirable use which the Composer
had made of his "strings"&mdash;I didn't see that he had any
"strings," but I said, "Ah, yes,"&mdash;his "Wood-wind and Horns."
"Just observe his horns!" said my neighbour enthusiastically. He
spoke of Mr. <span class="smcap">C. V. Stanford</span> as if he were drawing the portrait of
Ancient Nicholas, as portrayed by <span class="smcap">Cruikshank</span> when illustrating
<i>The Lay of S. M&eacute;dard</i>, in the <i>Ingoldsby Legends</i>. A Composer
with Strings, Wood-wind ("comest thou with blasts from&mdash;&mdash;" &amp;c.,
as <span class="smcap">Baconspeare</span> hath it) and "horns" is the man to write a <i>cantata</i>
entitled "Herne the Hunter," and I am not at all sure that there
isn't a <i>Herne</i> already in existence, and that that Herne isn't
His'n. After a pause (during which the orchestra continued
playing) my neighbour begged me to notice that now the theme was,
"Remember the glories of <span class="smcap">O'Brien</span> the Brave," but at this point
not wishing to enter into a political discussion which might have
landed me in the police-station, I courteously, but firmly, wished him
good night, and having signified to everybody generally the extreme
pleasure I had derived from the entertainment provided by the
Messrs. <span class="smcap">Novello and Ewer</span>, I gracefully withdrew, and am, No
Fellow, but Ewers truly,</p>

<p>P.S.&mdash;<i>&Agrave; propos</i> of music, I cannot refrain from mentioning the
gathering of the <i>&eacute;lite</i> who recently collected together to do honour to the
talents of Mrs. <span class="smcap">Dutton Cook</span>. Madame <span class="smcap">Albani</span> was in great force,
and the fair <i>b&eacute;n&eacute;ficiaire</i> played with her customary grace and
artistic feeling, eliciting the invariable result of unbounded applause.
It is to be greatly regretted that the Public have not the opportunity
of hearing Mrs. <span class="smcap">Dutton Cook</span> more frequently. She is certainly in
the first rank of pianists and a sound musician.</p>

<p>"I hear," said Mrs. <span class="smcap">Ram</span>, "that the Princess <span class="smcap">Christian</span> has written
about the <i>Margarine of Baireuth</i>. I like to hear of Royalty
interesting themselves in such matters. However," she added, "of
course, they know which side their Bread's buttered, and like the
butter, whether at home or abroad&mdash;that is, here or at Baireuth&mdash;to
be of the very best. So do I."</p>

will open them out. (<i>Captain nods assent. To men.</i>) Open order!
<span class="right">[<i>Flank files rear rank step back two paces.</i></span></p>

Now, my men, I hear that some of you require to know something
about the Law of Entail. Now those of you who have taken any
certificate from a University can take a pace to the front. March!
(<i>The entire Company complies.</i>) Dear me! You seem to be very
well educated. Eh, Sergeant?</p>

<p><i>Sergeant.</i> Well, pretty well, Sir. We are not equal to E Company,
although we can hold our own fairly against B, C, D, F, and G. As
for H Company, it is out of the competition altogether. H Company
is the best read Company in the Battalion, if not in the Regiment.</p>

<p><i>Captain.</i> Well, what is the difficulty? Call out the man who
started the subject. Perhaps I may be able to help him.</p>

<p><i>Sergeant (salutes and turns to Company).</i> Private <span class="smcap">Thomas Atkins</span>
take three paces to your front. March! Now then, salute, Sir!<br />
(<i>Aside.</i>) This extra education makes them rusty with their drill.</p>

<p><i>Captain.</i> Well, Private <span class="smcap">Atkins</span>, can I help you at all?</p>

<p><i>Private Atkins (touching his rifle with his right hand).</i> A thousand
thanks, Sir, for your extreme kindness and courtesy. Still I cannot
fairly monopolise all your attention, as I was only one of many
desirous of learning a little law.</p>

<p><i>Captain.</i> I suppose you know all about the Feudal System?</p>

<p><i>Private (smiling).</i> I can safely undertake to say that there is not a
man in the Company who does not appreciate its provisions.</p>

<p><i>Captain.</i> Quite so. Well, the practice of entail is founded more
or less on the Feudal System. You understand the advantages and
disadvantages of Primogeniture?</p>

<p><i>Private.</i> Certainly, Sir. I suppose Borough English was rather
before the time of the Norman Conquest?</p>

<p><i>Captain.</i> I imagine so: but perhaps the best way will be for you
all to come to my quarters, where I can explain the matter more fully
to you than I can here. I have no doubt the Colonel will excuse the
Company, if I inform him for what purpose we propose absenting
ourselves. At any rate I will ask him.</p>

<p><i>Private.</i> A million thanks, Sir. I am sure every man in the
Company will be grateful to you.</p>

<p><i>Sergeant.</i> Right about turn! Quick march! Halt! Front!
Shoulder arms!</p>

<p><i>Captain.</i> Stand them easy while I go away. (Sergeant <i>obeys
order, and</i> Captain <i>approaches and salutes</i> Colonel.) Beg pardon,
Sir, but may I march my Company to my quarters to give them a
lecture on law?</p>

<p><i>Colonel (rather querulously).</i> Well, <span class="smcap">Dash</span>, of course I'm not going
to say No; but it really is rather rough upon me. Here B Company
has got permission to study botany, C Company the elements of
engineering, D, F, and G chemistry. I shall be left with H Company,
because they have nothing more to learn. What on earth
shall I give them to do if you are off too?</p>

<p><i>Captain.</i> Wouldn't presume to suggest, Sir; but mightn't H have
a little practice in the rudiments of drill?</p>

<p><i>Colonel.</i> By Jove, you are right! They are rusty enough! Very
well, you may go.</p>

<p class="hang">[<i>Scene closes in upon A Company marching towards</i> Captain

<h2>THE CHIMES.</h2>

<p class="center">(<i>Dickens once again adapted to the Season and the Situation.</i>)</p>

<p>High up in the steeple of an old old Tower, of ancient foundation,
somewhat incongruous and complicated in design, but of sound Constitution&mdash;as
<i>everybody</i>, even the angriest campanological opponents,
admitted&mdash;far above the light and the noise of the town, if far below
the flying clouds that shadow it, dwelt the Chimes I tell of.</p>

<p>They were old Chimes, trust me. Centuries ago those Bells had
been hung by our ancestors, so many centuries ago, that the register
of their first suspension, the record of their first peal, was lost in
antiquarian mist as impenetrable as the darkness of the belfry
corners on a starless November night. They had had their donors
and sponsors, these Bells; but time had mowed down their donors,
and mislaid the names of their sponsors, and they now hung nameless
and dateless, but sound and sonorous still, in that high old Tower,
time-worn but steadfast and four-square to all winds, Party or
otherwise, that have blown or that shall blow.</p>

<p>Not speechless though. Far from it. They had clear, loud, lusty,
sounding voices, had these Bells; and far and wide they might be
heard upon the wind. Much too sturdy Chimes, moreover, were
they, to be dependent upon the mere pleasure of the wind, of any of
the winds&mdash;Party or otherwise&mdash;aforementioned. They had been
pulled at by many generations of ringers, pulled at sometimes skilfully,
often awkwardly and ill; sometimes in tune, and with the
well-ordered harmony which was natural to them; sometimes again,
wildly and wilfully, by incompetent or angry ringers, ringers ill-matched
and ill-accordant, who did their worst to mar their melody,
and spoil their tunefulness, and upset their time, and make them
sound, in the great Singer's words:&mdash;</p>

<p class="center">"Like sweet bells jangled, out of tune, and harsh."</p>

<p>But the fault was ever less in the Bells than in the Bell-ringers.
Cracked were they not, nor were they cacophonous; let their
clappers swing free, and keep their throats unrusted and unclogged,
and in skilled, and loyal, and well-conducted hands, they would
ever sound out strongly and sweetly, and send forth on and against
the wildest and angriest of the winds aforesaid, most excellent and
inspiring music.</p>

<hr />

<p><i>Toby</i> knew them well, those Bells, as did his great and genial
Master. <i>Toby</i> was not a canine casuist. Being but a simple and
loyal dog, he invested them with a strange and solemn character.
They were so mysterious and mighty; often heard, and never seen;
so high up, so far off, and so full of such a deep, strong melody, that
he regarded them with a species of awe; and sometimes when he
looked up at the dark arched windows in the tower, he half expected
to be beckoned to by something which was not a Bell, and yet was
what he had heard so often sounding in the Tower, the Spirit,
namely, of Loyalty and Love, of Honour and of Home. For all this,
<i>Toby</i> scouted with doggish disdain&mdash;being, like his Master, as
sensible as loyal&mdash;a certain occasionally flying rumour that the
Chimes were haunted, as implying the possibility of their being
connected with any Evil thing. And <i>Toby</i>&mdash;no unlicked cub, but a
considerate, composed old dog,&mdash;never puppyishly barked at the
Bells. He would as soon have thought of baying the moon.</p>

<p>But he often had occasion to yap, warningly or reprovingly, at the
Bell-ringers!</p>

<hr />

<p>Bow-wow-wow! It was the voice of <i>Toby</i>. It meant not, this
time, either warning or reproof; rather amicable acknowledgment,
and just a little surprise. Not fear, oh, no! not fear.</p>

<p>A Voice&mdash;was it a vision-voice, or the accents of the biggest of the
Bells, or was it, perchance, the veritable Voice of Time himself,
naturally and fitly vocal and audible at this particular Season?&mdash;sounded
strangely through the shadowy belfry. Thus it seemed to
speak, in words curiously pertinent to the moment, though <i>Toby</i>
seemed to have heard them before in other connection and in other
circumstances.</p>

<p>"The Voice of Time cries to Man, Advance! Time is for his
advancement and improvement; for his greater worth, his greater
happiness, his better life; his progress onward to that goal within
its knowledge and its view, and set there in the period when Time
and he began. Ages of darkness, wickedness, and violence have
come and gone&mdash;millions uncountable have suffered, loved, and
died&mdash;to point the way before him. Who seeks to turn him back, or
stay him in his course, arrests a mighty engine which will strike the
meddler dead, and be the fiercer and the wilder, ever, for its momentary
check!"</p>

<p>"A rub for the reactionaries!" mused <i>Toby</i>.</p>

<p>"Who puts into the mouth of Time, or of its servants, a cry of
lamentation for days which have had their trial and their failure,
and have left deep traces of it which the blind may see&mdash;a cry that
only serves the present time, by showing men how much it needs
their help when any ears can listen to regrets for such a past&mdash;who
does this does us wrong."</p>

<p>"A flout for our Fair-Traders!" thought <i>Toby</i>.</p>

<p>"Who hears in us, the Chimes, one note bespeaking disregard, or
stern regard, of any hope, or joy, or sorrow, of the many-sorrowed
throng; who hears us make response to any creed that gauges human
passions and affections, as it gauges the amount of miserable food on
which humanity may pine and wither, does us wrong."</p>

<p>"What would the contemners of the people's claims, the deriders
of the people's miseries, make of <i>that</i>, I wonder?" meditated <i>Toby</i>.</p>

<p>"Who hears us echo the dull vermin of the earth, the Putters
Down of crushed and broken natures, formed to be raised up higher
than such maggots of the time can crawl or can conceive, does us
wrong."</p>

<p>"Pity the shriekers for unlimited Suppression can't hear <i>this</i>!"
cogitated <i>Toby</i>.</p>

<hr />

<p><i>Bow-wow-wow!</i> Again it was the voice of <i>Toby</i>. This time it
did mean warning, if not reproof. Not anger exactly; anger alone
is scarce suited to the Christmas season.</p>

<p>The Bell-ringers were going it. With plenty of energy, unquestionably,
but with scarcely as much discretion as might be desired. A
rather mixed lot. Each one individually an excellent hand at the rope,
no doubt. Evergreen <span class="smcap">Will</span>, of the leonine front, and flying silvery
whisps of hair! Black-a-vised <span class="smcap">Bob</span>, of the broad shoulders and
resolute tug. Stolid, but sturdy <span class="smcap">Harty</span>, of the firmly-planted feet
and granite grip! Fiery though mild-featured <span class="smcap">Joachim</span>; sombre,
smug-faced, but enthusiastic <span class="smcap">John</span>! Last, though perhaps hardly
least (in his own estimation, at all events), rattling <span class="smcap">Randolph</span>, light-weight,
none too firm of footing, but full of dash, and game to

<h2>THE CONSCIENTIOUS APPARITION;</h2>
<h3>OR, THE PHANTOM BILL OF COSTS.</h3>

<p class="center">(<i>A Legal Ghost Story for Christmas.</i>)</p>

<p>I am a highly respectable family ghost. I appear usually at two
in the morning, wearing, what I believe is called in theatrical circles,
a disguise cloak, and carrying a long blood-stained sword. I have
one serious drawback. I have a shocking memory, and have entirely
forgotten my identity. For the death of me I cannot remember why
I became a ghost, and what on earth I ought to haunt. I fancy it
should be some sort of castle, as I have an indistinct recollection of
once frightening a man carrying some huge keys, from what I take
must have been a portcullis, into fits. But this is merely conjecture,
and I can't in the least account for my blood-stained sword. As I
am really conscientious, this state of things has caused me serious
regret. I have no wish to alarm the wrong people, nor to haunt the
wrong place. The first is improper, and the second is <i>infra dig</i>.
But what can I do? I find that I must appear at least once in every
four-and-twenty hours, and my difficulty has been to so suit my
time and place, that the least inconvenience should be given to the
smallest number. Consequently, for many years I have been a
nightly <i>habitu&eacute;</i> of the South Kensington Museum. No doubt this
arrangement would have continued for an indefinite period had I
not been recently arrested by a Policeman for loitering in the picture-galleries,
who only permitted me to vanish in blue fire (I prefer
blue to red) on the condition that I did not re-enter the Institution.</p>

<p>Ousted from the South Kensington Museum, I determined not to
visit any other public establishment. Partly because I was tired
beyond measure of curiosities, and partly, because my dignity had
been wounded by the incident that had severed my connection with
the School of Art. Supplementary to this, I felt that I might be
neglecting a duty by not discovering the proper place for my
periodical apparitions. It occurred to me it would be a great
comfort if I could but find the exact spot, where undisturbed, I
could appear and disappear without fear of interruption, at any rate,
from the profession, for I knew that I should not be allowed to
poach on the haunting-grounds of my fellow phantoms. As a
matter of fact, I once had a terrible row in the Tower of London,
(caused by Sir <span class="smcap">Walter Raleigh</span>, Lord
<span class="smcap">Balmarino</span>, and Lady <span class="smcap">Jane
Grey</span> objecting to my joining the little gathering there, on the
score "that I did not belong to their set") which ended in my
being ejected in the most undignified manner possible from the
premises. However, I am pretty determined when I make up my
mind, and I formed the resolution of leaving no stone unturned until
I had discovered my proper destination.</p>

<p>My first experiments were most unsuccessful. I visited in
succession about a hundred country-houses, but found them all
tenanted with their rightful apparitions. My arrival was greeted,
in each case, with abuse, more or less vigorous. Perhaps I received
the greatest insults from a person (I cannot call him a gentleman)
of the last century, who I discovered haunting a venerable mansion
belonging to his grandson, with a view to giving their brand-new
family an air of respectability.</p>

<p>At length I found a rather agreeable lady in white brocade, who
carried her head in a bundle under her arm, and who was more
inclined to be sociable than any ghost I had hitherto met.</p>

<p>"You cannot possibly remain here," she said, as she glided up a
staircase and rattled some chains outside a bedroom door, "it would
not be proper, besides it would be sure to be resented by <span class="smcap">Alfredo</span>,
who rises every fifteenth of March from the moat to cut my head
off in a fit of jealousy&mdash;he is so absurd! If I were you I should
consult a Solicitor. I can recommend you one who hanged himself
some years ago in the town over yonder. His great great great
grandfather drew my marriage settlement; and <span class="smcap">Alfredo</span>, who has
consulted him on several little matters, has every confidence in him.
Why not see him? You will find him seated in his office (it belongs
to his nephew in the daytime) from midnight to four in the morning.
And now you must really go, as I have to frighten the occupants
of this bed-chamber."</p>

<p>Thus urged, of course I could only bow and withdraw. I floated
into the town and entered the Lawyer's office. I found its phantom
occupant extremely obliging.</p>

<p>"The great difficulty," he said, when he had listened to my story,
<a class="pagenum" id="page_299" title="pg 299">[pg 299]</a>
"is to ascertain your identity, which can only be done in the daytime.
Have you ever appeared at noon?"</p>

<h3>IN LOWTHER ARCADIA AT CHRISTMAS TIME.</h3>
</div>

<p>I admitted that I had, although I was obliged to confess that I had
found my apparition then both feeble and unsatisfactory.</p>

<p>After consultation, we decided that perhaps we might find some
trace of my antecedents in the Imbecile Inquiry Office, a Government
Department devoted to the registration of human curiosities.
It was not impossible that I might have been so extremely eccentric
in my lifetime, that some trace of my doings might have been preserved
in the archives of the <i>bureau</i>. The next morning, accompanied
by my Lawyer, I visited the office, and was requested by a
messenger to put in writing on a memorandum paper the object of
my application. Fortunately the man was short-sighted, and did
not appear to notice our appearance. I wrote what I wanted, and
sent it up. In a few minutes the messenger returned.</p>

<p>"The Board is engaged at this moment, but if you like to stop, the
Secretary will see you by-and-by." He then left us.</p>

<p>After waiting nearly an hour, my Lawyer and I came to the conclusion
that we must have been forgotten, and determined to go upon
a voyage of discovery on our own account. Leaving the waiting-room,
we glided up a broad stone staircase and entered through a
green-baize door a large apartment apparently filled with books.
Seated at a desk was an amiable-looking, middle-aged gentleman
surrounded with plans, papers, packets, and the usual paraphernalia
of a Government Office. Between this room and another was a second
green-baize door dividing the two apartments the one from the
other. In the second room we saw several other amiable-looking
middle-aged gentlemen, grouped round a long table, and apparently
engaged in discussing sandwiches and sherry.</p>

<p>"I am sorry to disturb you," said my Lawyer, courteously. The
amiable-looking middle-aged gentleman at the desk, raised his eyes,
looked at us, started violently, and turned as white as a sheet. My
Solicitor continued, "We want to know&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>He could get no further. The gentleman jumped up from his
desk in an agony of terror, and, before we could prevent his departure,
disappeared with an unearthly yell, through the baize door into
the second apartment. The door was then hurriedly locked, and all
we could do would not induce any of the occupants of the room to
open it. We tried in vain all sorts of inducements, from the rattling
of heavy chains up to thunder-thumps. Some little time elapsed,
and then the short-sighted messenger made his appearance.</p>

<p>"I never told you to come up," said he, in an aggrieved tone,
"and you've got me into trouble. You must be off. The Board
say that your application, whatever it is, can't be entertained."</p>

<p>To retire was all we could do&mdash;and we did it. On regaining the
street, I sorrowfully bade my Solicitor good-bye.</p>

<p>"Oh dear no, Sir," he said, with the ghost of a smile. "You
have quite forgotten one little formality&mdash;my Bill of Costs."</p>

<p>Upon this he produced an enormous roll of paper! The rest of my
story can be briefly told. Unable to pay my Lawyer's bill, I was
compelled to seek refuge in a country where I could not be reached
by the Extradition law. I took a passage in <i>The Flying Dutchman</i>,
and went to Spain. I am now settled in Grenada, where I am
believed by the peasantry to be an English ghost that has escaped
from a branch of the Moorish Alhambra that has been recently
established in Leicester Square. I find some consolation in the
thought that those whom I now haunt seem to be growing rather
fond of me. I trust that this is not a specimen of the national
politeness, and that the affection they apparently entertain towards
me is not merely assumed to save me unnecessary embarrassment.</p>

member of the Representative body of Theatrical
Managers and Music Hall Proprietors that called upon him last week
to protest against the further extension of Inspecting Powers to the
Metropolitan Board, having expressed a wish to hear something still

which was referred to in the course of the proceedings, the

<p>In re-introducing them, Mr. <span class="smcap">Jackson Partland</span>, M.P., said that
since their last interview they had heard that, with a view to the

for their use <span class="smcap">A Complete Letter-writer</span>, a few of the proof-sheets
of which had chanced to come into their possession. As they seemed
to have some bearing on the present case, they thought that perhaps
the <span class="smcap">Home Secretary</span> might like to look at them. In presenting them
to his notice, they felt it was hardly necessary to point out that a
public Department from which such documents might be expected to
issue was scarcely calculated to inspire that general confidence so
essential to the smooth and efficient working that might reasonably be
expected of it. The subjoined proof-sheets, which he appeared to peruse
with much attention, were then handed to the <span class="smcap">Home Secretary</span>:&mdash;</p>

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Begg</span> wishes to know whether Mr. <span class="smcap">Harris</span> takes him for a
fool. Mr. B. particularly told Mr. H., that he wanted him to let
him have the Queen's Box for six consecutive nights, <i>as he wished to
give his</i>, Mr. B's., <i>Tradesmen a treat</i>. How does Mr. H. think Mr.
B. is going to manage that in suitable style, in sixteen undated
Stalls! But perhaps Mr. H. is desirous of <i>provoking an Official
Inspection</i>, and would like to be called on to provide a new set of
dressing-rooms, a couple of iron-curtains, and be ordered to rebuild
his Entrance Hall. Mr. B. merely throws this out as a hint, but
would advise Mr. H. <i>if he wishes to keep out of trouble</i>, to despatch
the demanded boxes, to the addresses already furnished him
forthwith.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Home Secretary</span> said, that after giving the above specimens
of correspondence his careful consideration, he could not say that he
thought them particularly out of the way, but as there somehow
seemed to be a general impression that they were, he supposed something
ought to be done. He would think the matter over, and
perhaps in the course of next summer he might possibly hit on some
solution.</p>

<p>The Deputation having thanked him, then withdrew.</p>

<h2>"ALL THE TALENTS."</h2>

<p>The <i>Graphic's</i> big picture, representing "All the Talents" of Her
Gracious <span class="smcap">Majesty's</span> reign grouped together in one tremendous crowd,
directed apparently on their way down (ominous this!) by Sir <span class="smcap">Jem</span>
of the Academy, contains some of the best portraits that have
appeared in any collective illustration. Each one of them separately
would be entitled to a place in the splendid <i>Victoria Album</i> recently
issued by <span class="smcap">Smith and Downes</span>, and to say this is saying a great deal.
<i>The Graphic</i> Stage-Manager has grouped his characters most appropriately.
On the extreme right of the spectator is Sir <span class="smcap">Frederick
Leighton</span>, P.R.A., staring across at Sir <span class="smcap">Jem</span> as if wondering why on
earth the latter was taking so much authority into his own hands.
The Baroness <span class="smcap">Burdett Coutts</span> is well in front, evidently determined
to get out first before the crush comes,&mdash;an idea that, apparently,
has also simultaneously occurred to Messrs. <span class="smcap">Chamberlain</span>,
<span class="smcap">Browning</span>, <span class="smcap">Ellen Terry</span>, and Lords <span class="smcap">Charles Beresford</span>, <span class="smcap">Tennyson</span>,
<span class="smcap">Salisbury</span>, <span class="smcap">Gladstone</span>, "our Mr. <span class="smcap">Tenniel</span>," Mrs. <span class="smcap">Bancroft</span> (without
Mr. B., which accounts for the vacant space next to her, so perhaps
he was late, or has politely gone to fetch Mrs. <span class="smcap">Kendal</span>, with whom
he will appear in the millionth re-issue of this picture), H.E. Cardinal
<span class="smcap">Manning</span>, apologising for accidentally treading on Madame PATTI'S
dress (but it really couldn't be helped), who are all getting away as
quickly as possible, either because Mr. <span class="smcap">Sala</span>, up at the back, or Sir
<span class="smcap">Arthur Sullivan</span> (who is looking about for Mr. <span class="smcap">Gilbert</span>) has
shouted out, "Get on in front there!" Perhaps&mdash;ah!&mdash;they are all
hurrying off to the Refreshment Room! Or going to stir the
Christmas Pudding.</p>
